Welcome to the **UVWizard** project! This add-on for Unity aims to simplify the process of combining multiple materials and textures on a 3D model into a single material with a unified texture atlas. This documentation will guide you through how the project works, its current status, future plans, and how you can contribute.

(This project was made during the 2024 [Hack K-State Hackathon](https://hackkstate.tech/))

## **Introduction**

**UVWizard** is a Unity add-on designed to optimize 3D models by:

- Combining multiple materials into a single material.
- Repacking UVs to correspond with a new texture atlas.
- Merging multiple textures into one texture atlas.

This tool is particularly useful for reducing draw calls and improving performance in games and applications that use complex models with multiple materials.

## **Understanding UV Mapping and Project Motivation**

### **What are UVs and How Do They Work?**

UV mapping is the process of projecting a 2D image texture onto a 3D model's surface. The letters "U" and "V" denote the axes of the 2D texture space, as "X," "Y," and "Z" are already used for 3D space. Each vertex in a 3D mesh is mapped to coordinates in the 2D texture, allowing the texture to wrap around the 3D geometry. 

Here is a great youtube video explaining everything you need to know to understand UV-mapping: [![UV Maps Explained](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Yx2JNbv8Kpg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx2JNbv8Kpg)


#### **Example**

### **Importance of Efficient UV Packing**

Efficient UV packing involves arranging the UV islands (sections of the mesh that are mapped to the texture) as tightly as possible within the texture space. This maximizes the usage of the texture's resolution, resulting in higher-quality textures and better visual fidelity.

Poor UV packing can lead to wasted texture space, lower resolution for individual UV islands, and visible seams or artifacts on the model. By optimizing UV packing, we can:

- **Increase Texture Resolution**: Larger UV islands utilize more pixels, improving detail.
- **Reduce Texture Size**: Efficient packing allows for smaller textures without sacrificing quality.
- **Improve Performance**: Smaller textures consume less memory and bandwidth.

#### **Example**

### **Project Motivation**

Many creators, especially in communities like VRChat, design avatars and models without extensive knowledge of game optimization techniques. They may not be aware of the performance drawbacks associated with using multiple materials and meshes, which add additional Draw Calls and hurt performance. 
My aim with this project is to add a one-button solution to automatically optimize avatars without losing much, if any, quality.

I highly recommend watching this video to learn the heavy performance impact Draw Calls have on a runtime: [![Unity Performance Tips: Draw Calls](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IrYPkSIvpIw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrYPkSIvpIw)

Common issues include:

- **Multiple Materials**: Each material on a model can add a draw call, impacting rendering performance.
- **Multiple Meshes**: Each mesh on a model can add a draw call, impacting rendering performance.
- **Inefficient Texture Usage**: Textures not fully utilized due to poor UV packing waste valuable resources by over using multiple meshes and/or materials.

#### **Challenges with Existing Solutions**

Existing material combining tools often align textures to a simple grid layout when merging multiple materials. For example, combining four materials might divide the texture atlas into four equal quadrants, reducing each original texture's resolution to 25%.

This method leads to:

- **Loss of Texture Quality**: Significant reduction in detail due to smaller allocated texture space.
- **Inefficient UV Usage**: Not all UV islands may need equal space, leading to wasted areas.

#### **Example**

### **UVWizard's Solution**

**UVWizard** addresses these issues by:

- **Automated Optimization**: Takes a model or avatar and optimizes it to use a single material without losing quality.
- **Advanced UV Packing**: Packs UV islands as tightly as possible to maintain high resolution for each part of the model.
- **Preserving Texture Quality**: By efficiently using the texture space, the original texture quality is maintained.

#### **Benefits**

- **Improved Performance**: Reduces draw calls and optimizes texture usage, leading to smoother experiences, especially on devices with limited resources.
- **Accessibility**: Makes it easier for non-developers to optimize their models without deep technical knowledge.
- **Enhanced Community Interaction**: More users can enjoy detailed avatars across different platforms, including standalone VR headsets like the Oculus Quest.

### **Use Case in VRChat**

In VRChat, many users create avatars that are not optimized for standalone VR headsets. Quest users often cannot see these avatars correctly, hindering community interaction.

By using **UVWizard**:

- **Creators** can easily optimize their avatars for all platforms.
- **Users** benefit from better performance and a richer visual experience.
- **Community** engagement is enhanced as more users can see and interact with detailed avatars.

Ultimately, UVWizard improves community connectivity, performance, ease of development, and reduces compute costs.

## **How It Works**

The UVWizard script performs the following steps:

1. **Mesh and Material Retrieval**: Accesses the mesh and materials from the selected GameObject.
2. **UV Repacking**: Adjusts the UV coordinates to fit within designated regions of a new texture atlas.
3. **Texture Atlas Creation**: Combines individual textures from each material into a single texture atlas.
4. **Material Creation**: Generates a new material that uses the combined texture atlas.
5. **Application**: Applies the new UVs and material back to the mesh, replacing the original materials.

By automating these steps, UVWizard streamlines the process of optimizing models for better performance.

## **Roadmap**

### **Planned Features**

- **Advanced UV Packing Algorithms**: Implement more efficient UV packing techniques to optimize texture space usage.
- **Support for Additional Texture Maps**: Extend functionality to include normal maps, specular maps, and other material properties.
- **Editor Extension**: Develop a custom Unity Editor window for a more user-friendly interface.
- **Runtime Support**: Optimize the script for runtime use, allowing dynamic models to be processed during gameplay.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Improve feedback and error messages for better troubleshooting.

### **Milestones**

1. **v1.0**: Basic functionality with manual script execution.
2. **v1.1**: Editor window integration for easier use.
3. **v2.0**: Advanced UV packing and support for additional texture maps.
4. **v2.1**: Runtime optimization and enhanced error handling.
